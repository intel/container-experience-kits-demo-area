# Introduction

This tutorial will be a demo for a number of technologies for enabling NFV features in Kubernetes. 

For all requirements for the hands-on session checks the table of contents below. The audience will be provided with a SSH connection to work on the virutal env. Please check with the lab co-ordinators during the session for the assistances.

Abstract details as follows:

> _*"In this tutorial, you will get to put your hands on the keyboard and spin up a Kubernetes environment and enable some NFV features that can be used today. This includes Kubernetes Networking and computing features.
The Kubernetes world is often focused on web-scale problems -- in the NFV world (and the high performance networking world-at-large) we have a lot of problems to solve that aren’t just simply “a single interface with HTTPS traffic”. You'll have a walkthrough to get a Kubernetes cluster up, and look into attaching multiple network interfaces to pods using Multus CNI, - a CNI plugin that allows you to attach multiple network interfaces to your Kubernetes pods and have an introduction on using SR-IOV from pods. You'll be introduced to a number of tools to get you equipped enough to get involved in the open source community in which these tools are being developed."*_

Through this hands-on lab session,  you will learn about Intel’s Container Bare Metal Experience Kits, and Kubernetes features that will enable you to develop NFV use cases in Container-bare-metal deployments
